projects from an intro CS class (was taught the fundamentals, in C).

# Project 1
Part 1: This program checks if a seat is open or taken in a classroom with 11 rows of seats, each with 16 seats.

Part 2: This program creates seating charts with user-inputted data, and also outputs seating charts that shows taken and open seats.

# Project 2
Part 1: This program categorizes exoplanets compared to planets in our own solar system based on user input and presents the data with the use of lists and histograms through the use of arrays, loops, branching, etc.

Part 2: This program checks if exoplanets are habitable or unhabitable through multiple checks with the use of user-defined functions, arrays, loops, branching, etc.

# Project 3
Part 1: This program creates an elevation map while allowing the user to enter an x and y location to get the elevation at that point. If the location entered is at a peak, it specifies which hill the user is on. All of these functionalities are achieved through the use of structures, functions, 2D arrays, loops, etc.

Part 2: This program maps out a hike based on given input by the user (starting location, uphill, or downhill) with the use of structs, functions, loops, etc.


# Project 4
Part 1: This program sets up the structure for the next half of the project where we use functions that manipulate location data as well as store them with linked lists.

Part 2: This program reads in file data from a GPS attached to participants of Le Tour De France and outputs an analysis of that data with the use of functions, pointers, linked list, etc.
